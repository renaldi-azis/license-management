Description : 

I need to build a license management server that can connect via API. The goal is to easily integrate it into an application using Python requests to verify user licenses.

Detailed Requirements:

- Develop and configure a license server.

- Provide API support to:
    Create / revoke / validate license keys.
    Manage license status (expired, blocked, active).
    Log usage history and requests.

    - Easy integration with Python (simple request calls).

    - High security, resistant to cracking or bypassing.

    - Anti-spam mechanism (e.g., rate limiting, token-based authentication).

    - A dashboard or at least a simple way to manage license keys (web/admin panel preferred).

Requirements (Message): 

 - Yes i am currently using app script and encountered a case where bad guys continuously send data through api, this leads to google marking it as spam and client requests cannot be fulfilled, can you handle this?

 - If using server to manage license, can avoid "quota limit" error bro?

 - 1 more thing, I have multiple software, can the server manage licenses for those software? Or can 1 server only be used for 1 single software?

 - i checked the website, i need to edit as follows:
 - 1. remove the register button, create me 5 default accounts as follows:


 richtoolsmmo01 — RichTools2025!
 richtoolsmmo_backup — RichBackup21#
 huytoolsmmo01 — HuyTools2025!
 huytoolsmmo_admin — HuyAdmin#77
 richtoolsmmo.huy — RtHuyHome99


 - 2. in addition to entering 'UserID', add values ​​(credit number, machine code)
 - 3. with the value (credit number), if i do not enter, then the API result returns with this value is None

- license 'copy' button and 'details' button in created account doesn't work when selecting in 'Licenses', other than 'Dashboard' it can show 'details'
- add search box so I can search license by account name or license value

- when deleting a license, can I add a button to permanently delete that license if I want?
- I want to add a backup button to an excel file too

- Running Steps

database_init : python -c "from models.database import init_db; init_db()"
server_run : flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
