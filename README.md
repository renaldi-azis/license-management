Description : 

I need to build a license management server that can connect via API. The goal is to easily integrate it into an application using Python requests to verify user licenses.


Detailed Requirements:

- Develop and configure a license server.

- Provide API support to:
    Create / revoke / validate license keys.
    Manage license status (expired, blocked, active).
    Log usage history and requests.

    - Easy integration with Python (simple request calls).

    - High security, resistant to cracking or bypassing.

    - Anti-spam mechanism (e.g., rate limiting, token-based authentication).

    - A dashboard or at least a simple way to manage license keys (web/admin panel preferred).

Requirements (Message): 

 - Yes i am currently using app script and encountered a case where bad guys continuously send data through api, this leads to google marking it as spam and client requests cannot be fulfilled, can you handle this?

 - If using server to manage license, can avoid "quota limit" error bro?

 - 1 more thing, I have multiple software, can the server manage licenses for those software? Or can 1 server only be used for 1 single software?
